### Description

Blank Engine is an open-source + 3d Game Engine. It will allow you to take your first step in creating a game. Blank Engine will supply a complete listing of many commonly use game features.
 
### More Info
 
I assume that you either know, or are willing to learn how to create a game, and the basics behind creating a game. I will always be able to help someone who is interested in learning how to make a game. I also assume that you have a basic to intermediate knowledge of VB6, again you can always learn how to program with VB6.

If you do not have a video card that supports DirectX 8.1 then you should probably get one before trying to use Blank Engine.
